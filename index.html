            <h2>Hi, I'm Vasilis</h2>
            <p>I'm a 29 year old <b>game programmer</b>, <b>web developer</b> 
            that's currently a graduate from Hanze University of Applied
            Sciences at Creative Media & Game Technologies. <br>
            <br>
            I decribe myself as a <b>problem solver</b> that seeks opportunities to
            <b>learn</b> new things, while <b>constantly improving</b> my skills.
            I'm a <b>team player</b> since all of the projects that I worked on game
            programming were team based projects. I enjoy difficult challenges and
            I always <b>find multiple solutions</b> to a problem, so the team can 
            have a variety of options to decide. That is why I did my Internship with
            <b>Bram Dingelstad</b> who works as a consultant to improve my problem
            solving skills. Prior to that I worked as a QA Tester for Placeholder
            Gameworks on the released game CraftCraft Fantasy Merchant Simulator. I
            have from team and personal projects 2 games published on itch.io.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm a self taught <b>web developer</b> which I started it as a side 
            project because I had an interest in <b>web developing</b> and I wanted to 
            learn more about it. I'm a <b>fast learner</b> since in the span of 4 years
             I have learned 8 programming languages <b>(C#, GDScript, GML, HTML, CSS,
             JavaScript, Python and a bit of Rust).</b></p>
